# FreeAgency

FreeAgency is a free implementation of ChoiceScript

## Status

FreeAgency is currently in a pre-alpha status. A lot of critical features are still missing. Also, in many cases FreeAgency is a lot less strict than ChoiceScript. This will probably change in the future.

### Working

* Tokenizer
* Parser
* Interpreter
* \*choice
* \*create, \*set, math and logic parser
* standalone \*if, \*elseif, \*else
* \*finish

### Missing
* \*if, \*elseif, \*else embedded in \*choice
* All forms of \*goto
* Loading scenes from files
* Support for multiple scenes
* All other commands

## Getting Started

Pull the repo and open index.html with a browser of your choice (should be compatible with FF, Chrome, IE11, Edge).

### Prerequisites

Just the browser.

## License

I have not decided on a licence yet. For now, don't use this project in anything productive and every change in the code should be made public and added as a pull request here. This might change in the future.
